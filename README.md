## Scope üî≠

The database for CS50 SQL project, I worked on this project and named as **Neighbourly**, which is a **Local Marketplace Support System**. The database that I had designed includes all entities which are necessary to support the process of local businesses, connecting customers, business owners, and delivery agents. The database handles the listing of products and services, order placement, payment tracking, delivery agent assignment, and user's ratings, and system logging. As such, included in the database's scope is:
* **Users**, like Customers, Business-Owners, Delivery-Agents, including basic information like name, username, password, location, address and role etc.
* **Businesses**, which include owner information, location & address, operating hours, and the market domains they belong to.
* **Products**, that are offered by businesses, including the particular product's models, pricing, stock levels, and category they belong.
* **Services**, that are also offered by businesses, which includes the information about their availability, pricing, duration, and categories.
* **Product Orders**, the orders are done through and represented by **User Carts**, which hold information related to order status, items ordered, quantities, price at time of order, and assigned delivery agents or user's self pick (as the system is dedicated to local marketplace support).
* **Service Orders**, the orders that are requested or booked by the users to receive service, which includes order status, service details, quantity, and price at the time of order.
* **Payments**, for both product and service orders, the payment section holds information like payment-status, payment-mode, amount-paid or to-be-paid, and paid-on (date or timestamp).
* **Ratings and comments**, which are provided by users for products and services they have received.
* Operational **Locations**, including the information about the areas where this system operates and manages its operations.
* **Market Domains**, to determine in classifying businesses, products, and services.
* **System Logs**, as tracking is the significant aspect for data movements (Insertions, Deletions, Updations) across **core** and **lookup** tables, which extends scope for, analysis for future assessments, and for decision making.

Out of scope for this project involve aspects like direct user-to-user messaging, complex promotional or discount systems, delivery agent commission tracking, detailed inventory management, specific payment gateway operations, and advanced delivery route optimization.

## Functional Requirements üìà

The database will support:

* CRUD operations for users (all roles), businesses, products (and product's models), and services.
* Association of businesses with relevant market domains (products/services).
* Tracking product orders (via carts) through various statuses (pending, confirmed, out-for-delivery, delivered, cancelled, etc.).
* Tracking service orders through various statuses (pending, confirmed, in-progress, completed, cancelled, etc.).
* Managing product stock levels automatically, based on order confirmation and cancellation/returns (with triggers).
* Managing service availability slots automatically based on order confirmation and completion/cancellation (with triggers).
* Assigning delivery agents to product orders (user's carts).
* Recording payments associated with product carts and service orders, including different payment modes and statuses (pending, completed, refunded, etc.).
* Allowing users to rate and comment on products (and product's models) and services they have completed/received.
* Implementing business logic and data integrity through use of column-constraints, table-constraints, foreign-key-constraints and triggers (e.g., user role validation for business ownership, status transition restrictions, password history checks, rating eligibility etc.).
* Logging significant data movements, changes in core tables with a dedicated **logs** table.
* Provides various pre-defined views for simplified querying of common information patterns (e.g., user counts per location, product/service summaries, active users, pending payments, top sellers etc.).

## Representation üñ•Ô∏èüöß

Entities are captured in SQLite tables with the following schema.

### Entities

The database includes the following entities:

#### `A. LOOKUP TABLES`

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-1`: **`locations`**</u>
The `locations` table holds information about the locations where this system's hubs operates and manages it operations so that the users can use it for digital collaboration with their customers and business owners.

It includes:
* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for each location as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `municipality`, which specifies the town, city or village name as `TEXT`.

* `state`, which specifies the state name as `TEXT` that the corresponding `municipality` and `district` exist in.
* `country`, which specifies the country name as `TEXT` that the corresponding `municipality`, `district`, and `state` exist in.
* `pincode`, which specifies the zip-code or pincode of the location as `TEXT`, which helps uniquely identifies a location precisely, the reason for storing it as a `TEXT` is, as some pincodes involve special characters and can be of any length between 4 and 10.

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-2`: **`market_domains`**</u>
The `market_domains` table holds information about the different domains of the businesses that are available in most of the markets.

It includes:
* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for each market domain as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `type`, which specifies the type of the domain as `TEXT`, which has few pre-defined values with a `CHECK` constraint applied, that determines whether the domain belongs to *product*, *service* or *both*.

The `order_statuses` table holds information for the types of statuses for all products and services orders.

It includes:
* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for each order status as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.

#### `B. CORE TABLES`

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-6`: **`users`**</u>
The `users` table holds information of every user, the user can be a customer, business_owner, and delivery_agent.

It includes:
* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for each user as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `name`, which specifies the full-name or actual-name of the user as `TEXT`.
* `username`, which specifies the user's simple identifiable name i.e username as `TEXT`, and to ensure each and every user has unique username `UNIQUE` constraint applied, including that a `CHECK` constraint also applied to check the length of the username of user's.
* `password`, which specifies the user's password that he/she uses to sign in or sign up to the system, at the application level it can be hashed with a specific algorithm, but due to the limitations of SQLite3 I applied `TEXT` as it's type, and also applied `CHECK` constraint to check the length of the user's password.
* `age`, which specifies the user's age as an `INTEGER`, and I enforced a `CHECK` constraint to check whether the `age` mentioned is valid or not.
* `gender`, which specifies the gender of the user as `TEXT`, and included a `CHECK` constraint to validate the gender to be in pre-defined values.
* `phone`, which specifies the mobile/phone number of the user's, having a `CHECK` constraint to validate the format and length of the user's phone-number, as a phone number contains the special characters `TEXT` type used, and as the phone number must needs to be unique for each and every user `UNIQUE` constraint used.
* `email`, which specifies the email of the user's as `TEXT`, and included a `CHECK` constraint to validate the format and length of the email, enforced a `UNIQUE` constraint to ensure the user's email must be unique to another users, and added a `DEFAULT` constraint with `NULL` value, as some user's might not interested to provide the email based on their consent.
* `address`, which specifies the address of the user's as `TEXT`.
* `location_id`, which specifies the `PRIMARY KEY` of the `locations` table, that is being referenced to as the id of the location where the `address` might correspond to, thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `locations` table.

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-7`: **`businesses`**</u>
The `businesses` table holds the basic information about all the businesses.

It includes:
* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for each business as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `owner_id`, which specifies the ID of the user who has `business_owner` role in `users` table, that is being referenced to as id of the user in `users`, , thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `users` table.
* `name`, which specifies the name of the business as `TEXT`.
* `address`, which specifies the address of the business as `TEXT`.
* `location_id`, which specifies the `PRIMARY KEY` of the `locations` table, that is being referenced to as the id of the location where the `address` might correspond to, thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `locations` table.
* `open_time` and `close_time`, the both specifies the timing of the business working hours which has given `NUMERIC` type, which is relevant to store time/date type data, and also implemented `DEFAULT` values to maintain `NULL` free records.

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-8`: **`business_associations`**</u>
The `business_associations` is the associative/junction table that holds the information which business belongs to which domain

It includes:
* `business_id`, which specifies `INTEGER` that references to the `id` in `businesses` table, to point out the one or more domains maintained by the same business. For example: A restaurant can deliver the food they make as a product `(product-based-domain)`, and the same restaurant can also serve their customers as a service `(service-based-domain)`, thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `business` table.
* `domain_id`, which specifies `INTEGER` that references to the `id` in `market_domains` table, that points the actual domain the business is pointing out, thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `market_domains` table.

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-9`: **`products`**</u>
The `products` table holds the information of the product's name, business that is selling, and what category or market domain does it belong etc.

* `name`, which specifies the name of the product as `TEXT`.
* `category_id`, which specifies the ID of the domain i.e category, which is being referenced from `market_domains` table, as a product might belong to certain category or domain for extra detail, thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `market_domains` table.
* `UNIQUE("business_id", "name")`, which specifies the pair of `business_id` and product's `name` is needs to be `UNIQUE`, to avoid the redundancy the `UNIQUE` constraint applied.

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-10`: **`product_models`**</u>
The `product_models` table holds the information about the certain product's models/variants.

It includes:
* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for product model as `INTEGER`. Thus this column has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `product_id`, which specifies the ID of the product in `products` table as `INTEGER`, to identify where the certain model points to which product in `products` table, thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `products` table.
* `size`, which specifies the size parameter of the product model as `TEXT`, whereas it can involve the various metrics of size based on products and their models so `TEXT` is appropriate to apply, and the `DEFAULT` value as `NULL` is applied as all product-models don't have size parameter.
* `color`, which specifies the color parameter of the product model as `TEXT`, and the `DEFAULT` values as `NULL` is applied as all product-models don't actually rely on color parameter. So, the `TEXT` is appropriate to store color based values. (For more in advance we can also store HEX-codes as `BIGINTEGER` or `INTEGER`).
* `weight_kg`, which specifies the weight parameter of the product model as `REAL`, and the `CHECK` constraint is applied to allow the product-model's weight to be **greater than 1 gram** and **less than 1000 kilo gram**, to avoid unrealistic weights as input, for the cases when there is no-need for weight parameter for the product-model's `DEFAULT NULL` constraint used.
* `material`, which specifies the type of material that the product-model made up of as `TEXT`, and similarly to `weight_kg` for the cases when there is no-need for material parameter for the product-model's `DEFAULT NULL` constraint applied, and the `TEXT` type is appropriate to hold the name-type fields.
* `price`, which specifies the price of the product-model as `REAL`, and a `CHECK` constraint applied to make the price **greater than 1**.
* `available_stock`, which specifies the stock that is available for the product-model as `INTEGER`, and the `CHECK` constraint applied to validate the stock not going in to negative values, and `DEFAULT 0` constraint used incase of incorrect input given.
* `min_order_qty`, which specifies the minimum stock to order as `INTEGER` value, a `CHECK` constraint is used to specify the minimum order requirement value **should not be less than 1**, and `DEFAULT 1` constraint used incase of incorrect input given.
* `mfg_date` and `exp_date`, the both specifies the dates of product-model's manufacture date and expire date (in case if it has) as `NUMERIC` values, and `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` constraint applied in case of not manufacture date given.
* `UNIQUE("product_id", "size", "color", "weight_kg", "material", "price", "mfg_date", "exp_date")`, which specifies the set of a product-model for a certain product referenced from `id` as `product_id` must have a `UNIQUE` record of product-model, to avoid redundancy the `UNIQUE` constraint applied for the set of columns.

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-11`: **`user_carts`**</u>
The `user_carts` table holds the information of user's cart that allows user to order 1 or more than a product at a time.

* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for user's cart as `INTEGER`. Thus this column has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `user_id`, which specifies the ID of the user as `INTEGER`, that is being referenced from `users` table, to point out which user ordered which cart at a particular period of time/days/months, thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `users` table.
* `ordered_on`, which specifies the date of the cart was ordered as `NUMERIC`, and `DEFAULT NULL` is applied pending carts hold ordered-on date to be NULL.
* `status_id`, which specifies the ID of the status in `order_statuses` table, which states the status of the order whether it is delivered, returned, or cancelled etc., here `DEFAULT 0` constraint used for the reason it can only be 0 when a `DELETE` was made on `order_statuses` based on `FOREIGN KEY` constraint.
* `delivery_agent_id`, which specifies the ID of the user who is a `delivery_agent` in `user_role` of `users` table as `INTEGER`, here `DEFAULT 0` points to the imaginary `delivery_agent` named `self-pick-up` in `users` table as the name suggests, as this is a local marketplace support system, some users might pick their cart on their own rather than getting it delivered, so for those cases there is a key user in `users` table with `id-0`, and it is the `DEFAULT` value when a `delivery_agent` is not assigned for the certain cart, and for the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint used to set `NULL` value as the `delivery_agent` lefts (`DELETE ON` `"users"` table) from the system, thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `users` table.

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-12`: **`product_orders`**</u>

* `price_at_order`, which specifies the price of the product_model as `REAL` when it is ordered via a cart, a `CHECK` constraint is applied to validate the **price needs to be greater than 0**.

##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px dashed">`TABLE-13`: **`cart_payments`**</u>
The `cart_payments` table holds the information about cart's payments statuses and mode, paid on information, and total price of cart etc.

* `status_id`, which specifies the ID of the payment's status as `INTEGER`, that is being referenced from `payment_statuses` table to map the status of the payment - whether it is pending, completed, cancelled etc., thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint is applied to link this to `payment_statuses` table, and a `DEFAULT 0` value is used in the case of `FOREIGN KEY` constraint `ON DELETE` action the default value 0 is placed, as the value-0 points to the deleted status in linked table (`payment_statuses`).
* `mode_id`, which specifies the ID of the payment's mode as `INTEGER`, that is being referenced from `payment_modes` table to map the mode of the payment that done or being done - whether it is cash, phonepe, google-pay, etc., thus the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links this to `payment_modes` table, and a `DEFAULT 1` value is used in the case of `FOREIGN KEY` constraint `ON DELETE` action the default value 1 is placed, as the value-1 points to the cash payment-mode in the linked table (`payment_modes`).
* `paid_on`, which specifies the date, when were the payment was made.

* `rated_on`, which specifies the timestamp (date + time) as `NUMERIC` in which the comment or rating recorded.
* `PRIMARY KEY("user_id", "product_model_id")`, this defines a composite primary key using the combination of `user_id` and `product_model_id`. This constraint is applied to uniquely identify each rating record, furthermore it ensures that each combination of `user_id` and `product_model_id` can only appear once to avoid redundancy.

### C. Triggers
I came up with the following triggers the increase the functionality of the schema very much, although most of them can be handled in application level but I had taken a deep consideration on data-integrity and consistency, thus made the following comprehensive triggers for the schema.
Logically, I came up with `4 types of triggers` they are:
* **<u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px dashed">Logging Triggers</u>**, triggers that keep track of data movements within database.
    -<details open>
        <summary>
            <b><u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px dotted;">Information about logging.</u></b>
        </summary>
        I came up with a separate, dedicated table called `TABLE-19: logs` that holds and records the data movements with the help of **<u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px dashed">Logging Triggers</u>**.
                <br><b>`TABLE-19:` logs</b><br>
                The `logs` table that holds the logs of all tables in the database, which further help in analysis, historical tracking, recording crucial changes etc.
                <br>
                It includes:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>`id`, which specifies the unique ID of the log that has recorded by the `triggers`. Thus this column is the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint.</li>
                    <li>`record_id`, which specifies the ID of the specific record in target tables when there is a movement in data through operations in it.</li>
                    <li>`table`, which specifies the name of the table that had affect with data movements, and stores it as `TEXT`, a `CHECK` constraint is applied to validate only valid table names come in input.</li>
                    <li>`operation`, which specifies the type of operation made on corresponding `table`, the operation can be `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, and this data is stored in `TEXT`, as `CHECK` constraint is applied to validate the `operation` value is falls under pre-defined values.</li>
                    <li>`column`, which specifies the name of the column of the corresponding `table` that had affected after/before the `operation` it is stored as `TEXT`.</li>
                    <li>`old_value`, which specifies the old-value whenever an `UPDATE` - `operation` takes place on
                     a `table` and this column `old_value` holds the record of old-value of a `UPDATE`.</li>
                    <li>`new_value`, which specifies the new-value whenever an `UPDATE` - `operation` takes place on a `table` and this column `new_value` holds the record of new-value of a `UPDATE`.</li>
                    <li>`description`, which specifies the description of the `operation` that made on target-`table` on a certain `column`.</li>
                    <li>`timestamp`, which specifies the timestamp of the `operation` when it was recorded, to keep real-time tracking `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` was applied.</li>
                </ul>
     </details>

* **<u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px dashed">Restricting Triggers</u>**, triggers that restrict certain operations on certain tables based on certain conditions to maintain integrity and security of the data.
* **<u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px dashed">Validating Triggers</u>**, triggers that validate whether the data is valid enough to get in through operations like `INSERT`,`UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
* **<u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px dashed">Automating Triggers</u>**, triggers that automate (automatically process data in corresponding tables) certain when certain changes occur in certain table with certain operation.

***The following are the `triggers` tables wise:***
#### 1. Triggers on `users` table
##### <u style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px dashed;">1.1 Logging Triggers:</u>
* **`log_new_user`**
* **`log_left_user`**
* **`log_user_updates`**

The above triggers are used for logging user's data movements like when operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) takes place. The `log_new_user` - automatically logs the bit information of new-users along with a `timestamp` states that when their account was created. The `log_left_user` - logs the deletion of users (users who left from the system) by records their `username` and the `timestamp` states that when did they actually left. The `log_user_updates` - tracks the updates of user's information like `password`, `phone`,`email` and `user_role` to monitor the user activity, thus these triggers assist in maintaining logs which are useful for tracking and monitoring user's activity.

The `log_new_product_order` - logs new product orders, which records the `product_model_id` and `cart_id` to track the product additions in carts and user order trends. The `log_removed_product_order` - logs the removed product orders, by recording the `product_model_id`, and `cart_id`, to track product removals in carts to assess the demand of the product. The `log_product_orders_update` - tracks the updates on product-order's information, by tracking the `qty` (quantity - to track the demand of the product), and `price_at_order` (to track the discounts and price-trends at orders).

## Limitations üìâ
There are several limitations when compared to the real-world application, and yet I tried my utmost to work on this project to make it aligns with the real-world applications.
***The following are the `limitations` that are observed:***
* The current schema assumes a business is owned by only one user account. The partnerships or multiple owners would require changes in the schema.
* The schema doesn't handle complex inventory concepts like batch tracking, stock reservations, or varying service slot durations within a single service.
* The `passwords` in the schema are stored as `TEXT`, but in a real-world application, they absolutely hashed before storing, whereas the triggers checking password changes history (`logs` table) works on stored values, which is very insecure if not hashed.
* There is no built-in mechanism for communication between users (for example, `customer` asking a `business owner` a question).
